Method of Growing Electrically Conductive Tissue

Abstract
An electrical circuit is comprised of a sheet of mycelium having a wiring pattern for an electrical circuit thereon. The sheet of mycelium is prepared from a solution of Potato Dextrose Broth and Potato Dextrose Agar that is inoculated with a macerated tissue culture including a filamentous fungi selected from the group consisting of Basidiomycota, Ascomycota and Zygomycota. A sheet of tissue that grows on the surface of the solution is extracted, plasticized and dried prior to being formed with the wiring pattern.

Method for producing grown materials and products made thereby

Abstract
The composite material is comprised of a substrate of discrete particles and a network of interconnected mycelia cells bonding the discrete particles together. The composite material is made by inoculating a substrate of discrete particles and a nutrient material with a preselected fungus. The fungus digests the nutrient material over a period of time sufficient to grow hyphae and to allow the hyphae to form a network of interconnected mycelia cells through and around the discrete particles thereby bonding the discrete particles together to form a self-supporting composite material. In another embodiment, the fungus is allowed to grow as a fruiting body out of the substrate and within an enclosure to completely fill the enclosure to form a self-supporting structure.
